# AI-Notes-And-Resources

This repository maintains my running notes of courses undertaken, books and papers read, tutorials completed as well as a collection of resources during my learning of various domains in Artificial Intelligence. Please find the last updated contents:

## NLP Course by Lena Voita

I am adding my own MD notes from taking the course, as well as supplementary information either by following a derivation/extra reading exercise, or consulting other articles / courses like Jay Alammar's blogs etc. 

## Deep Reinforcement Learning

Since I am diving into this subject for the first time, I am learning from a mixed bag of sources, including but not limited to: Huggingface's Deep RL Course, Berkeley's Deep RL Course, and other links / blogs I find online. I also add annotated resources like Richard Sutton's 'Bitter Lesson', etc.
